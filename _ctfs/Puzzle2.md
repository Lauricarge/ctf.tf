It is a program that runs under Win32 - WinME tested, should be ok under Win95/98. Not sure about NT/2000. It was written in Borland C++ with some minimal inline asm. The executable is 4.5Kb.

There is only one task:

1. Run the program and you will be presented with a dialog box with two edit boxes, an ok button and a cancel button. Your task is to find out how to get the 'Well done, you solved puzzle2 message' rather than the 'erm, you failed' message when you press ok. You are not allowed to modify the executable file or patch the process in any way.
