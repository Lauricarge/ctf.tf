Here's  a  little toy for all you to play around. All you have to do
is to get this program registered. And, of course - no patching! :)

As  usual,  after  you've done with this, you may access the sources
and  a  little greeting from me in the archive. The password will be
whatever  the  stuff  is  required to get this program registered to
grandmother.  And,  I  sincerely  hope  that I won't have to see the
solutions  which start by stating the zip cracker used to get to the
sources (been there, seen that).

And,  my  slight  apologies to all who expected to see the sequel to
"elf'z crackme 3: ancient crypt". Maybe next time :)


Best regards, and good luck -
