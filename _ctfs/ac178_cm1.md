# Solution
First, I just looked for the message box 'invoke' commands. Then, once I located all three of them, I looked at each on of them a little closer. If you look at the last one, you will notice that it is the nag message box. So, if you think logically, if you re-code that part to skip this message box, then you will have cracked it. 
So, instead of Nopping it all out, which is one choice, I just decided to put a Jmp ExitProcess in instead.
I changed this:
00401026  PUSH 0   ;Style = MB_OK|MB_APPLMODAL
To this:
00401026  Jmp ExitProcess

Easy, no?
Have phun!
