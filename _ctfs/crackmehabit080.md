Crackme Habit 0.80 notes,
 
Goal: Try to find the right combination to unlock the code,
and make the box say "Registered" difficulty about (7/10).

I can not say much about it, I can say one thing when you are 
able to unlock it you are addicted to cracking!   
In the first regbox (Key no 1) you only have to look for numbers
(0 - 9), however the second regbox (Key no 2) it needs ASCII
(from 32 (dec) = space to 122 (dec) = z).

The source is included however it's protected your unlock key
will be the key 2.  
Example ( key no 2 = ABCDEFGHIJ12 you unlock code
Will be: ABCDEFGHIJ12 ).


And the usual disclaimer:
Whatever happens when you running this program,  
I'm not responsible for anything.  
  
If you have any comment or questions please mail,

I want to greet everyone who knows me.
